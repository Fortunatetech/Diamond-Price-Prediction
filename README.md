## Introduction

Diamond Price Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts the price of diamonds based on various features like carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z). This project combines data version control (DVC) to manage datasets, a machine learning model for predictions, and a Flask web application for easy interaction.

## Features

- Predicts the price of diamonds using a machine learning model.
- Manages datasets and model versions with DVC.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface to input diamond features and get price predictions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Fortunatetech/Diamond-Price-Prediction-with-DVC-Flask-Streamlit.git
   cd diamond-price-prediction

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   [Optional] Install DVC and set up DVC remotes for dataset version control.


Usage
Access the Flask web application via your browser.

Enter the diamond's features: carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, x, y, and z.

Click the "Get Prediction" button to obtain the predicted diamond price.
