## Introduction

Diamond Price Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts the price of diamonds based on various features like carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z). This project combines data version control (DVC) to manage datasets, a machine learning model for predictions, and a Flask web application for easy interaction.

## Features

- Predicts the price of diamonds using a machine learning model.
- Manages datasets and model versions with DVC.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface to input diamond features and get price predictions.
